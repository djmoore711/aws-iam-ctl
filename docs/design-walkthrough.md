# iamctl Design Walk-through

## Overview

iamctl is a CLI tool for managing AWS IAM credentials with a focus on security and usability. It provides functionality for rotating access keys, managing passwords, and handling MFA.

## Architecture

The tool follows a modular architecture with the following components:

1. **CLI Layer** - Cobra-based command structure
2. **Business Logic Layer** - Command implementations
3. **AWS Integration Layer** - AWS SDK interactions
4. **Security Layer** - Credential handling and MFA enforcement

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Security-First Approach
- All sensitive operations require MFA
- No secrets are logged or printed
- Secure credential storage compatible with AWS CLI
- Memory sanitization for sensitive data

### 2. User Experience
- Familiar AWS CLI-like interface
- Clear error messages without exposing sensitive information
- Helpful command descriptions and examples

### 3. Modularity
- Separate packages for different functionality areas
- Well-defined interfaces for AWS services
- Extensible command structure

## Command Structure

```
iamctl
├── configure
├── keys
│   ├── rotate
│   └── disable
├── password
│   └── reset
├── mfa
│   ├── enable
│   ├── disable
│   └── status
├── status
└── enforce
    ├── mfa
    └── policy
```

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement proper mocking for enforce command tests
2. Implement proper MFA status check in status command
3. Add more comprehensive IAM policy enforcement features
4. Support for additional authentication methods

## Security Considerations

1. All AWS SDK interactions use secure credential chains
2. Context timeouts prevent hanging operations
3. Memory zeroing for sensitive data
4. Unified error messages prevent information leakage
