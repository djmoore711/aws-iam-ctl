# Phase 2 Completion Summary: AWS Utilities Layer

## Overview

Phase 2 of the iamctl project has been successfully completed. This phase focused on implementing the AWS utilities layer using AWS SDK for Go v2, which provides the foundational components for all IAM operations.

## Files Created

1. `internal/aws/client.go` - Implements NewIAMClient function for creating secure AWS IAM clients
2. `internal/aws/mfa.go` - Implements MFA handling for sensitive operations
3. `internal/aws/utils.go` - Implements GetCurrentUser function with proper error classification
4. `internal/aws/client_test.go` - Contains tests for the AWS utilities functions

## Key Features Implemented

### Secure AWS Client Creation
- Uses AWS SDK v2 `config.LoadDefaultConfig` for secure credential handling
- Implements 15-second timeout context for all operations
- Handles profile fallback to "default" when none specified
- Returns appropriate error types for credential failures

### MFA Support
- Implements MFA handling using `stscreds.NewAssumeRoleProvider`
- Supports token provider function for MFA-enabled operations
- Creates new configuration with MFA credentials

### User Information Retrieval
- Implements GetCurrentUser function with proper context handling
- Classifies errors into specific types (CredentialError, PermissionError, ServiceError)
- Uses Smithy API error types for proper error classification
- Never leaks sensitive details in error messages

### Security Measures
- Credentials are never exposed to memory longer than necessary
- Uses AWS SDK's built-in credential chain methodology
- Implements proper error handling without leaking sensitive information
- Passes security static analysis with no issues

## Testing and Verification

- All unit tests pass successfully
- Security static analysis (gosec) shows no issues
- Code compiles without errors
- Memory management follows AWS SDK v2 best practices

## Next Steps

With Phase 2 complete, we can now proceed to Phase 3: Building the first command - `iamctl status`.
