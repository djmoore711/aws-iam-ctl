# Phase 3 Completion Summary: Status Command Implementation

## Overview

Phase 3 of the iamctl project has been successfully completed. This phase focused on implementing the status command that displays information about the current IAM identity.

## Files Created/Updated

1. `cmd/status.go` - Implements the status command with proper integration with existing AWS utilities layer
2. `cmd/status_test.go` - Contains tests for the status command functions
3. `cmd/root.go` - Updated to include the status command

## Key Features Implemented

### Status Command Functionality
- Proper integration with existing AWS utilities layer from Phase 2
- Meaningful user output showing current IAM identity information
- Security-focused error handling using existing error types from Phase 2
- Profile flag support matching AWS CLI behavior

### Security Measures
- Uses the same 15-second timeout context pattern established in Phase 2
- Never displays raw errors that could leak sensitive information
- Proper profile handling matching AWS CLI behavior
- Security-conscious output formatting

### Error Handling
- Uses error types from Phase 2 implementation (CredentialError, PermissionError, ServiceError)
- Converts SDK errors to user-friendly messages without leaks
- Maintains consistency with the error handling patterns established in Phase 2

## Testing and Verification

- All unit tests pass successfully
- Security static analysis (gosec) shows no issues
- Code compiles without errors
- Proper integration with existing AWS utilities layer

## Next Steps

With Phase 3 complete, we can now proceed to Phase 4: Building the key rotation command - `iamctl keys rotate`.
